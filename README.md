# Payload 2024 code for NASA USLI Payload

This repository contains all code intended for the 2024 NASA USLI payload challenge - contained inside this readme are all the details regarding hardware setup as well as basic installation.

## Needed Hardware
    - Teensy 4.1
    - Raspberry 3
    - BNO085 IMU 
    - MPL3115-A2 Barometer
    - Standard Voltage Converter
    - 14.8/11.1 Volt LiPo Batteries

## Software Setup

Needed Software

    - Arduino IDE

Needed Libaries

    - Wire.h
    - Adafruit MPL3115A2.h
    - SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library.h
    - Math.h

## Guide for interfacing with Hardware

    - ENSURE LiPo's ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE TEENSY PRIOR TO CONNECTING PC
    - Connect PC using Mini-USB to Teensy 4.1
    - Open Arduino IDE and upload given code via board manager
    - Should be good to go! 

## Wiring Diagram

Wiring diagram and pinout guide should be published later upon first oppurtunity.
